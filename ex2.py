# I am learning about comments in this example
# Anything after # is ignored by python3

print("I could have code like this.") # and everything after is ignored

# Comments can be used to 'disable' (i.e., "comment out") code
# print("This won't run")

print("But this will run.")

# Does this work?
print("Hi # there.")
